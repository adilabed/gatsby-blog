I recently passed the [CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/) exam . It is a relatively easy exam compared to the [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/). It costs 300$ (You can find vouchers/promo code on the internet ), but It costed me half the price by attending the 2020 Kubecon EU.

The exam is a practical one, you get a shell, nineteen problems to solve and an access to the Kubernetes documentation.

There is an abundance of resources on the internet to prepare for this exam, one advice I have got for you is to practice small tasks and develop your muscle memory.By small tasks, I mean the creation of pods/deployments/secrets.

Practice debugging through kubectl commands: kubectl get X / kubectl describe Y.

I will share below list of resources that I personally feel the closest and most useful to prepare for the exam.

## Preparation resources:

- [https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep](https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep) If you have access to safari books that will be awesome in order to watch the accompanying videos.
- [https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises ](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises) Most important Kubernetes commands and tasks
- [https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes) Examples of network policies in Kubernetes, really useful repo
- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/) Do the tasks that are relevant to your exam, you will end up using some yaml files in the tasks during the certification exam.


I wish you good luck and hope my tips will be of useful to you.
