description: "Some of best resources in my opinion of books/blogs around infrastracture"
---

I'm mostly interested in DevOps and infrastracture as a code, that's why i compiled a list of books,blog posts and talks that I am in the process of finishing or just started reading.

I do not own the physical copy of any of these books, I purchased a Safaribooksonline membership that I find valuable.

So here is my list:

## Books

- Infrastructure as Code: Managing Servers in the Cloud by Kief Morris (O’Reilly)
- Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann (O’Reilly) (Several senior engineers recommend this book to prepare for technical interviews)
- Kubernetes In Action by Marko Luksa (Manning) (Am eagerly waiting for the second edition, really good book)
- Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems by Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff, and Niall Richard Murphy (O’Reilly)
- Release It! Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software by Michael T. Nygard (The Pragmatic Bookshelf)
